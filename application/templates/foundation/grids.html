<p>
  Grids provide a layout mechanism for organizing content into a grid.
  Foundation's
  <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html">built-in grid</a>
  allows for a large amount of flexibility, but for consistency, it's best to
  use one of the following grids.
</p>


{{ foundation.headers.h4("3 / 9 Grid", "3-9-grid") }}

<p>
  Use this grid when you need to mimic the side-bar + main content.
</p>

{{ examples.grid_with_code(["large-3", "large-9"]) }}


{{ foundation.headers.h4("3 / 6 / 3 Grid", "3-6-3-grid") }}

<p>
  Use this grid when you need to have side-bars on each side plus
  main content in the middle.
</p>

{{ examples.grid_with_code(["large-3", "large-6", "large-3"]) }}


{{ foundation.headers.h4("Other Grids", "other-grids") }}

<p>
  Below are a collection of other grids that you can use.  Be sparing in their
  use.  They're provided here for flexibility, but should not be used
  sporadically.  The key to a good grid-based layout is consistency.  Don't
  switch between different layouts on different pages without good reason.
</p>
