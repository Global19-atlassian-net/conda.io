Skeleton site for generating a Flask or static website


## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
conda env create
# or if you don't have conda-env installed
source activate conda.io
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

Note, [gulp][] will run the [Flask][] server via `server.py` after it has
compiled all of the required assets.
